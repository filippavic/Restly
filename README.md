# Restly

Restly is an Android app whose goal is to help people stay healthy while working longer, especially behind a computer or a mobile device.

As users begin their workday, they can activate Restly's timer, as well as turn on built-in relaxing sounds. Periodically, Restly suggests taking a short break.
Also periodically, but in longer intervals, Restly notifies the user it's time for head and eyes exercise.

Head and eyes exercises are done by holding the phone in front of the user - this way, Restly can use the front-facing camera and machine learning to track the user's head and eyes, in order to track exercise progress.


Restly was built as a project for *Programming Paradigms and Languages* course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Zagreb.
